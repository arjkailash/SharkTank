# SharkTank
An app which displays Shark images using flickr search apis. I made this app as part of an interview process for the Yahoo Flickr Team. The main aim of this app was to get the list of images for the search key "shark" using the Flickr APIs and display them in the form of a gallery. It also has options to download the image and open the image in the Flickr App/Web.
